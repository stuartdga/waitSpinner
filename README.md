# waitSpinner
Simple wait spinner with demo web page.

The wait spinner is created using CSS transforms, not by an image such as a .gif.
Then using animations to fade each section, the tranforms appear to spin.

The spinner class is then added to a div on the page.  A second div is also added to the 
page.  This div creates an overlay on the page that prevents other client actions
such as button or anchor clicks.

You can see the spinner in action in index.html.
